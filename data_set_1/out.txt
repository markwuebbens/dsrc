<--- HELLO. --->
We are simulating a straight, uni-directional highway which is 500 m long
The traffic density is set at 0.365 veh/m
Vehicles are traveling uniformly between 16 and 24 m/s
The simulation runs at increments of 1.3e-05 s
Vehicles are transmitting safety beacons over a 50 m range
msg len = 4000 bits, tx_rate = 3000000.0 bps, time to tx = 0.00133333333333 s
The CW window is set to: 0 <= CW <= 0.003328 s
